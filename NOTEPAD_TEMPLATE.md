# Creating a Clean Template

1. Open Notepad (regular Windows Notepad, not Word)
2. Type exactly these three lines (do not copy-paste):

```
Test Quote

Company Name: {{name}}
```

3. Save this as "template.txt"
4. Now open Microsoft Word
5. Go to File -> Open
6. Browse to where you saved template.txt
7. Open the text file in Word
8. Go to File -> Save As
9. Choose the public/templates folder
10. Save as "quotation-template.docx" (Word Document)
11. Close Word completely

This method ensures we're starting with plain text characters without any hidden Word formatting that might be causing the template tag duplication.
